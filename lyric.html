Finally, I washed your perfume off of my sheets
Threw out all your records reminding me
Moved out of the Hollywood Hills
Where we fell in love, damn, I feel it still
Wasted, I drink about you to all of my friends
I say that I'm good now, at least I pretend
Your face ain't burned in my brain
When it's late at night
I'm a moth to a flame

Get off my phone, leave me alone
Don't wanna think of all the ways that we went wrong
I can't resist, what hell is this?
On, it goes on, I need to forget and
Get you off my phone (do, do, do, do, do)
Get off my phone (do, do, do, do, do)
Need to get off my phone (do, do, do, do, do)
Get off my phone (do, do, do, do, do)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Face down, I hit the concrete and started to bleed
I wish I could call you, but now we don't speak
I'm fine in this dark motel
Feeling what we felt
I just hope you're well

Get off my phone, leave me alone
Don't wanna think of all the ways that we went wrong
I can't resist, what hell is this?
On, it goes on, I need to forget and
Get you off my phone (do, do, do, do, do)
Get off my phone (do, do, do, do, do)
Need to get off my phone (do, do, do, do, do)
Get off my phone (do, do, do, do, do)

I'm on a doom scroll, I hit a pothole
It keeps my heart broke, oh

Get off my phone, leave me alone
Don't wanna think of all the ways that we went wrong
I can't resist, what hell is this?
On, it goes on, I need to forget and
Get you off my phone (do, do, do, do, do)
Get off my phone (do, do, do, do, do)
Need to get off my phone (do, do, do, do, do)
Get off my phone (do, do, do, do, do)

Finally, I got your perfume off of my sheets
Threw out all the records that reminded me
Reminded me
